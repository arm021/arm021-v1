## HOBBIES & INTERESTS
- Toys (collecting, photography)
  - I really enjoy looking at my toy collection, by the way I collect DC 1:12 scale action figures. I keep the ones I really like, if it doesn't suit my taste, I sell them to buy something new.
- Music
  - I appreciate all genre but if I feel like I need to focus I listen to KPOP which is something that I can't understand so that I won't be singing along with it and distract me while keeping me awake since they are upbeat.
- Movies
  - I like the Nolan films, very deep and full of mysteries. I, also, enjoy watching superhero films especially DC Comics related ones.
